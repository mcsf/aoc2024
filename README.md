Architecture
-------

Solutions can be written in any language. Multiple solutions may be provided for a single day, for fun. A solution must be a file whose name starts with `run` and is executable. [Shebangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) determine how each program should be run. All programs, regardless of implementation language, must read puzzles from standard input and write the solution to standard output, one line per part of the puzzle.

Calling:

```sh
./run.awk < sample
```

Outputs:

```
1234  # solution to Part 1
5678  # solution to Part 2
```


Testing
-------

The following assumes that, in each day's directory, there is an `input` file and an `expected` file. The `input` file is not provided in this repository and should be your own puzzle input. The `expected` file is provided for my own record, but should be overwritten with your own expected solution output.

```
# Run all tests
./test.sh

# Run for a given day
./test.sh 04
```
